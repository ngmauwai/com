  <div class="entryMain">
    <div id="entry0">
      <div class = "headline">How you listen to a friend</div>
      <div class = "pBody">Data from a listener’s auditory cortex is used to identify which sound a listener wants to focus on, and that sound’s volume is increased for the listener. These technologies are “looking at your brain to figure out what your intentions are,” <strong> Nima Mesgarani </strong>says, “and based on that they modify the acoustic scene.”</div>
    </div>
    <div id="entry1">
      <div class = "headline">How your sight might be restored</div>
      <div class = "pBody">The chip <strong> Ken Shepard</strong> is designing could be used anywhere on the surface of the brain or even on a damaged spinal cord to amplify existing signals. It both stimulates underlying neural tissue and records information, mostly to monitor the health of underlying tissue. One early application may be helping blind people see again, by transmitting information from a camera to the visual cortex.</div>
    </div>
    <div id="entry2">
      <div class = "headline">How your memory might be enhanced</div>
      <div class = "pBody">In many memory disorders, the hippocampus fails to communicate properly with other brain regions. By recording from these brain regions together, <strong> Dion Khodagholy </strong>reasons that it will be possible to identify markers of this communication and boost it using responsive electrical stimulation – with the goal of improving the longevity of memories.</div>
    </div>
    <div id="entry3">
      <div class = "headline">How your brain makes snap decisions</div>
      <div class = "pBody">The ACC receives waves of electrical activity from the prefrontal cortex at 10 Hz. Stimulating the PFC each time it hits a particular phase of that wave causes the PFC’s activation to more strongly activate the ACC. <strong> Paul Sajda </strong>combines two forms of neuroimaging to measure the wave and figure out the optimal phase to amplify — thereby helping promote decision-making.</div>
    </div>
    <div id="entry4">
      <div class = "headline">How your brain stays sharp</div>
      <div class = "pBody">One hypothesized cause of Alzheimer’s disease is buildup of amyloid plaques in the brain, which may lead to tangled tau proteins that then kill surrounding cells. Tangled tau proteins have been found in young brains, too — but only in the LC. <strong> Qi Wang </strong>reasons that stimulating the LC in young people might release more of the hormone/neurotransmitter norepinephrine, thus allowing microglia—”scavenger” cells—to clear the plaques, preventing tangled tau proteins and cell death.</div>
    </div>
    <div id="entry5">
      <div class = "headline">How your brain stores memories</div>
      <div class = "pBody">When rats store information, there are electrical “theta” oscillations around eight hertz in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex, areas related to memory and navigation. Stimulating those areas in rats at that frequency has been shown to boost their retention. For years, <strong> Josh Jacobs </strong>notes, researchers have tried to do the same in humans, with mixed results.</div>
